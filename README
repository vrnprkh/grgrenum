To use make sure you have an input.txt file and output.txt file, and then just run main.py
Your input.txt can contain anything after #check ND / #check ST, comments, and should end at the end of your proof.

To add filters, add them to the "filters.txt" file, seperated by commas. If a line number contains any of a string in a filter, it will not renumber the line.
By default the filters.txt file contains just 'pr' (useful for premises)

See the sample input.txt, output.txt, and filters.txt provided for an example.
